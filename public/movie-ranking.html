<h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
<p>Hunter x Hunter follows the story of young Gon on a search to find his father.  This journey will lead him to take the hunters trial, rescue his new friend, learn about the power of Nen (functional magic) deal 
with a world spanning mafia, fend off attacks from an incredibly dangerous band of thieves, survive an incredibly dangerous game, fight against an incredibly dangerous species, and then help decide the fate of the Hunters Association.</p>

<h3>Hi-Score Girl</h3>
<p>Two young gamers find a connection that goes beyond video games. The story is told from Haruo's point of view, which leads to lots of humor as he slowly comes to terms with the fact that Akira is his equal in the gaming world, and that he might even like her.
Meanwhile, as the rather-reserved Akira slowly reveals details about herself, it becomes less difficult to understand why the two are able to relate so well to each other.</p>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>One Piece has the best world building of any anime series filled with interesting people from all walks of life interacting with each other even when they aren't on screen. One piece touches upon almost all the major world problems such as slavery, caste system, corruption in government, armes hoarding by major world powers, fanatic dictators, rewriting of historical facts by the rulers, poverty and false news spreading by media.
The following is a poem about the anime One Piece: </p>

<h4>One Piece Poem</h4>
<p> A young boy named Luffy, <br>

    At first he seemed kind of goofy,<br>
    
    But then he saw he was a tough little man,<br>
    
    And Luffy was a Shanks fan! So Shanks gave him his precious hat,<br>
    
    And soon Luffy and his crew ran into a crew with a cat<br>
    
    They beat them and set out to the grand line,<br>
    
    And with Nami as the navigator got there just fine.<br> </p>
